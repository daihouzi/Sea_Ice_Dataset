# Sea_Ice_Dataset
The dataset was first publicly used in the paper titled "Panoramic Sea-Ice Map Construction for Polar Navigation Based on Multi-Perspective Images Projection and Camera Poses Rectification."
It contains three pieces of polar navigation - related data with a duration of about 2 minutes each. Specifically, it includes: 1. GPS coordinate information of the navigation track and other ship motion information; 2. A series of photos taken by a set of three on - board cameras on the starboard side with a shooting interval of 1 second.
Due to GitHub storage limitations, the dataset is hosted at the following link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/179ReBbIWflcmK3VmACBZIA?pwd=hbxm.
Currently, only the data related to the first trajectory is available. For further access, please contact mdf2004@zju.edu.cn or 22234008@zju.edu.cn.

该数据集首次在论文《Panoramic Sea-Ice Map Construction for Polar Navigation Based on Multi-Perspective Images Projection and Camera Poses Rectification》中被公开使用
包含三段时长2分钟左右的极地航行相关数据，具体包含1.航行轨迹的GPS坐标信息及其他船舶运动信息；2.一组三台随船相机在右舷拍摄的系列照片，拍摄间隔1s。
由于GitHub空间限制，数据集被保存在链接: https://pan.baidu.com/s/179ReBbIWflcmK3VmACBZIA?pwd=hbxm
目前仅开放第一条轨迹相关的数据，如有需要请联系mdf2004@zju.edu.cn或22234008@zju.edu.cn
